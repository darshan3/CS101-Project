# BlackJack

I have used a library 'simplecpp' to make a simple blackjack game.
User initially gets 500 game money.
He/She can place bets till he/she runs out of money.
I also tried to implement a CPU Player which plays the game on its own.

Future improvements:

Add exit button.
Improve CPU player's predicting capabilities.
Make CPU player place bets depending on probability of winning.
